# stack

## Stack simple data structure implementation using c#

In a stack, the element deleted from
the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in, first-out,
or LIFO, policy.
In this repository you can find two implementation of stack: 

### 1) Array based stack

Easy but wrong way to implement stack, because each time number was pushed into stack, it must resize it's array size. 
### 2) Linked Stack

The right way to implement stack :)
